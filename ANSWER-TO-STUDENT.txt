2. Build the qserv-operator, following documentation: https://github.com/lsst/qserv-operator#build-qserv-operator, then add a field in Qserv CRD description and add a field "spec.xrootd.replicas" in file https://github.com/lsst/qserv-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/qserv_v1alpha1_qserv_cr.yaml which allow to start additional xrootd redirectors, implement support for this field in the qserv-operator and send a github PR to mentors.
